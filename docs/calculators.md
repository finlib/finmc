# Calculators

- In this package: `finmc.calc` contains calculators that can be used with any `finmc` model.
- Outside this package: [qablet-contracts](https://qablet.github.io/qablet-contracts/) defines a large selection of
financial derivative contracts that can be priced using `finmc` models.
Also see [project qatwalk](https://github.com/qatwalk/eq/blob/main/README.md) that leverages the selection
of contracts in `qablet-contract` with the selection of models in `finmc`.
